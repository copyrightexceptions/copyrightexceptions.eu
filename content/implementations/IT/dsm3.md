remarks: "Art. 70-ter also covers 'communication to the public of the results of the research', but only 'where expressed in new original works'.<br /><br />A clarification on the scope of TDM exceptions was added in 2025, by way of implementing the EU AI Act in Law no. 132 of September 23, 2025. This law introduces, inter alia, a new art. 70-septies in the Copyright Act, which explicitly states that art. 70-ter is applicable to the training of 'AI systems, including generative AI'.<br /><br />Under art. 71-decies, exceptions and limitations to authors' right apply also to the neighbouring rights. In addition, para 16 of art. 43-bis (press publishers' right) explicitly references the exceptions and limitations in Chapter V of Title I."
