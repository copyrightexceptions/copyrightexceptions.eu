- rightsholders can opt-out of the use in accordance with art. 102-quaterdecies
- use taking place in Italy by a CHI based in another Member State is understood to be made exclusively in the said Member State
remarks: "Although the exception appears to apply to all categories of subject matter, the awkward wording of para 4 of art. 102-duodecies seems to give rise to a legal presumption that the only subject matter for which there may be no 'sufficiently representative collective management bodies' are databases and computer programs. In practice, this relieves CMOs of any obligation to demonstrate that they are sufficiently representative for the purposes of extended collective licensing of specific rights outside of these two categories, thereby significantly limiting the scope of the exception.<br /><br />Under art. 71-decies, exceptions and limitations to authors' right apply also to the neighbouring rights. In addition, para 16 of art. 43-bis (press publishers' right) explicitly references the exceptions and limitations in Chapter V of Title I."
