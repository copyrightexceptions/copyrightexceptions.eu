This exception further states that if the use is carried out for teaching or scientific research purposes, the use must also take place for illustrative and non-commercial purposes. Furthermore, if the reproduction is made in anthologies for school use, it cannot exceed the measure determined by the regulation, which also establishes the method for determining fair remuneration.<br /><br />There's an exception allowing the free publication through the internet, free of charge, of low resolution or degraded images and music, for educational or scientific use and only if such use is not for profit. The limits of the didactic or scientific use referred to in this paragraph are defined by decree of the Minister for Cultural Heritage and Activities. <br /><br />There's an exception, which implements art. 5 DSM Directive, allowing the summary, quotation, reproduction, translation and adaptation of passages or parts of works and other materials and their communication to the public by digital means, exclusively for purposes of illustration for teaching, within the limits of what is justified from the non-commercial purpose pursued, provided that is under the responsibility of an educational institution, on its premises or in other location or in a secure electronic environment, accessible only to teaching staff of that institution and pupils or enrolled students to the course of study in which the works or other materials are used. This exception does not apply to material mainly intended for the education market and sheet music and to musical scores when appropriate voluntary licenses that authorize the uses specified therein are available on the market and when these licenses meet the needs and specificities of the institutes of education and are easily known and accessible by them. There's a cross-border provision stating that the uses made under this exception that take place in Italy by an educational institution that is based in another Member State are understood to be carried out exclusively in that Member State. <br /><br />There's a provision stating that the exceptions that are applicable to copyright apply also to performances, phonograms, film fixations and broadcasts.Under art. 71decies, exceptions and limitations to authors' right apply also to the neighbouring rights. In addition, para 16 of art. 43-bis (press publishers' right) explicitly references the exceptions and limitations in Chapter V of Title I"
