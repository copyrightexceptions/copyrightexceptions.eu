remarks: "The transposition of art.5.3.a. of the InfoSoc Directive in art.22 of the Law was amended in 2022 to accomodate for the implementation of art.5 of the CDSM Directive. The current exception covers both teaching and scientific research and is not restricted in terms of beneficiaries. The exception covers both teaching and scientific research and is not restricted in terms of beneficiaries. Art.22 also covers use for the purpose of assessing learning achievements, as well as the public performance and public display for cases where concerts and exhibitions constitute a part of education process carried out by these institutions. Despite this relatively broad scope, however, the implementation of art.5.3.a. is limited in terms of subject matter, as it applies only to small works or 'short excerpts' of works. The exception also covers neighbouring rights under art 58(1), p.5 of the Law, which permits the 'reproduction, communication to the public, for the non-commercial purpose of illustration for teaching or scientific research, of a short object of related rights lawfully published or communicated to the public or an extract of such object, provided that this is related to study programmes and does not exceed the extent justified by the purpose to be achieved.' In addition, according to art.32(5), 'educational institutions may, without the permission of the author or other copyright holder, but with an indication of the source, including the name of the author, unless this is not possible, reproduce and make publicly available via computer networks (on the Internet) a database for the purpose of using digital copies thereof solely as examples for teaching purposes, provided that such use takes place under the responsibility of the educational institution, on its premises or other locations, or using a secure electronic network to which only teachers, lecturers and students of the educational institution have access.'"
