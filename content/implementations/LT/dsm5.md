The exception covers both teaching and scientific research and is not restricted in terms of beneficiaries. Despite this relatively broad scope, however, it is limited in terms of subject matter, as it applies only to small works or 'short excerpts' of works. The exception also covers neighbouring rights under art 58(1), p.5 of the Law, which permits the 'reproduction, communication to the public, for the non-commercial purpose of illustration for teaching or scientific research, of a short object of related rights lawfully published or communicated to the public or an extract of such object, provided that this is related to study programmes and does not exceed the extent justified by the purpose to be achieved.'
