remarks: "Hungary has an exception allowing the use in another work, to an extent exceeding quotation (“borrowing”), of parts of a published literary or musical work or of a film, or small entire works of such nature, as well as pictures of works of fine art, architecture, applied art and industrial design creations, and photographic works, for the purposes of illustration for school education and scientific research, to the extent justified by the purpose (§34(2)). It also has an exception allowing the adaptation of a work in the course of in-person digital education or remote education (§34(4) 1st sentence). <br /> The use of a work that “borrows” from another work and the use of adaptations for the purpose of school education is permitted under another provision (§34(3)(b) and §34(4) 2nd sentence). This exception covers in-person uses in digital form on an electronic device at the place of school education and communication to the public through a secure electronic environment, provided that such uses are not made on a commercial basis. The exception does not apply to sheet music (§34(3b)), even if no licences are available in the market for such a category of works, which contradicts article 5(2) of the DSM Directive. The uses made under this exception shall be deemed to take place in the Member State in which the educational establishment is established (§34(3a)). <br /> There's an exception allowing the reproduction of parts of a work published as a book, as well as entire newspapers and periodical articles, for the purposes of school education or examination in public, vocational and higher education, in a number necessary for for the number of groups or classes of students (§35(5)). This exception allows the distribution, as well as the public communication of the copies, through the secure electronic environment of the educational establishment, to the pupils and students concerned. <br /> There's an exception allowing the use of the image of works of fine art, architecture, applied art, industrial works of design which constitute an artistic creation and photographic works in the course of scientific dissemination of knowledge (§68). <br /> There’s a text and data mining (TDM) exception for scientific research purposes covering reproductions of copyrighted works (§35/A(2)) in accordance with conditions that are identical to those defined in Article 3 of the DSM Directive. This provision also allows the act of making available copies of those works and other subject matter to a closed group of persons within the framework of a research cooperation or for purposes of peer review of the scientific work (§35/A(3)). <br /> There's a provision stating that, in the cases where the law allows the use of a copyrighted work without the authorization of the author, no authorization is required from the holders of neighbouring rights (§83(2))."
