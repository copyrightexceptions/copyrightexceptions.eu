The use foreseen in this exception does not apply to sheet music, and there's a cross-border provision stating that the uses made under this exeption shall be deemed to occur solely in the Member State where the educational establishment is established. 
There's an exception allowing the reproduction, distribution and communication to the pupils and students concerned, through the secure electronic environment of the educational establishment, of parts of a work published as a book, as well as newspaper and periodical articles, for the purposes of illustration for school education or exams in public, vocational and higher education in a number necessary for that purpose.

There's a provision stating that, in the cases where the law allows the use of a copyrighted work without the authorization of the author, no authorization is required from the holders of neighbouring rights.
