There's an exception allowing the use of the recipient work in digital form at the place of education, on an electronic device, or for communication to the public via a secure electronic environment, for the purpose of school education, provided that such uses are not made on a commercial basis.
There's an exception allowing the reproduction, distribution and public communication to the pupils and students concerned, through the secure electronic environment of the educational establishment, of parts of a work published as a book, as well as newspaper and periodical articles, for the purposes of illustration for education or for the purposes of exams in public, vocational and higher education in a number necessary for that purpose. A secure electronic environment is defined as a technical solution that prevents a work made available for retrieval from being carried out outside the scope of education and training.
There's a provision stating that, in the cases where the law allows the use of a copyrighted work without the authorization of the author, no authorization is required from the holders of neighbouring rights.
