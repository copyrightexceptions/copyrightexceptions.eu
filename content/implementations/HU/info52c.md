remarks: "The Hungarian implementation of Article 5(2)(c) of the InfoSoc Directive consists of several, albeit limited, use cases. Although it covers a wide range of uses, most are subject to various conditions. Section 33(1) of the Act limits the applicability of exceptions and limitations to works that have been made publicly available. This restriction of the material scope may somewhat constrain the preservation mission of the institution.<br /><br/>The exception applies to all neighbouring rights. Pursuant to Section 83 of the Act, the consent of neighbouring rights holders is not required where the author’s consent is not required. However, the exception does not appear to extend to sui generis database rights under § 84/D."
