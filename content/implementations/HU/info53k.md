remarks: "The exception was not implemented into Hungarian law until the transposition of art.17 of the CDSM Directive. However, it was introduced in the full scope of art.5.3.k of the InfoSoc exception.<br /><br/>Section 33 (1) of the law limits the applicability of exceptions and limitations to publicly available works only, while 33 (4) prohibits exclusion or restriction of free use by contract or unilateral legal declaration as null and void. The exception applies to all neighbouring rights. Pursuant to Section 83 of the Law, the consent of neighbouring rights holders is not required in cases where the author's consent is not required. The exception does not appear to extend to sui generis database rights under § 84/D."
