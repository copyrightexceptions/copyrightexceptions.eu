description: "This exception allows cultural heritage institutions to reproduce and communicate to the public, including make available to the public, on non-commercial websites, out-of-commerce copyright works and subject matter of related rights, which make a permanent part of their collections, for non-commercial purposes. The exception only applies to subject matter for which there is no collective management organisation existing in the Republic of Croatia." 
beneficiaries:
- cultural heritage institutions
purposes: 
- non-commercial
usage:
- reproduction
- communication to the public (on non-commercial websites)
- making available to the public (on non-commercial websites)
subjectmatter:
- works 
- performances
- phonograms
- film fixations
- broadcasts
- informative publications
- written editions
compensation:
- no compensation required
attribution: 
- name of the author or other rightsholder who can be identified must be indicated, unless proven impossible
otherConditions: 
- works used must make a permanent part of beneficiaries' collections
- use is not allowed if there is a 'representative' CMO for the respective subject matter
- uses are considered to take place only in the territory of the Republic of Croatia whenever a cultural heritage institution has a place of establishment in the Republic of Croatia
- the author may at any time, by an explicit written statement, exclude the application of the OOCW regime in relation to one or more or all of their works (art.17(4))
remarks: "The application of the exception appears to be contingent on the existence of a representative CMO, without an explicit requirement that it be 'sufficiently representative' within the meaning of the Directive (see also art. 223 of the Law).<br /><br />Under Article 181 (1) of the law, exceptions and limitations apply to both works (which must be divulged) and other subject-matter, subject to related rights. Article 181 (2) contains the requirements of the 3-step test."
