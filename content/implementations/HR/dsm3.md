remarks: "The law provides a definition for 'lawful access'.

All persons covered by subscriptions and use agreements are considered to have lawful access due to their connection with scientific organizations and cultural heritage institutions.<br /><br />Under Article 181 (1) of the law, exceptions and limitations apply to both works (which must be divulged) and other subject-matter, subject to related rights. Article 181 (2) contains the requirements of the 3-step test."
