remarks: "The term 'lawful access' is defined for the purposes of the research TDM exception in art. 187(5). It encompasses access to copyright or related rights- protected content based, inter alia, on a contractual relationship, including subscriptions, access provided under an open-access policy, or other legitimate means of obtaining access to such content. In addition, Article 188(4) and (5) specify what constitutes 'appropriate means of reserving rights', namely a machine-readable method that includes metadata, general terms and conditions relating to the website or service, contractual provisions, or unilateral statements by rightholders. Where copyright works or subject matter of related rights are made available to the public online, the only valid means of reserving rights, according to para 5, is a machine-readable method incorporating metadata and the relevant website or service terms and conditions.<br /><br />Under Article 181 (1) of the law, exceptions and limitations apply to both works (which must be divulged) and other subject-matter, subject to related rights. Article 181 (2) contains the requirements of the 3-step test."
