remarks: "Art. 5 of the CDSM Directive was implemented in a provision covering solely the use 'in digital and cross-border teaching activities', existing in parallel with art. 198 of the Law of 2021, that covers a general 'illustration for teaching' exception. Under para 2 of art.199, the use covers, inter alia, digital and online teaching, remote teaching and cross-border teaching in all levels of education. According to para 6, it also applies accordingly to activities of lifelong education conducted by state institutions, public establishments and other entities authorised to undertake such activities.<br /><br />There is a very broadly worded carve-out for materials intended for the educational market, without explicitly conditioning its application on the availability of appropriate licences.<br /><br />Art. 199 refers to art. 198(3) for a definition of 'illustration for teaching'. Pursuant to it, 'giving examples in teaching comprises the use of copyrighted works and subject matter of related rights, as a rule, in portions or segments, in order to support, enrich or supplement teaching and teaching activities within and outside of premises of educational establishments'. Furthermore, the provision refers to art. 198(4) for a definition of 'non-commercial purpose' which implies an individual teaching activity, provided that the organisational structure and financial means of an educational establishment are not decisive in determining if an individual teaching activity is of non-commercial nature'.<br /><br />Under Article 181 (1) of the law, exceptions and limitations apply to both works (which must be divulged) and other subject-matter, subject to related rights. Article 181 (2) contains the requirements of the 3-step test."
