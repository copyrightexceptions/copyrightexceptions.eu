remarks: "Although the exception is fairly broad, the little case law available applies an extremely expansive interpretation of the non-commercial requirement, thus effectively hindering the application of the exception.<br /><br />Since 2023, the respective referencing provisions for neighbouring rights include references to the entire art. 24.<br /><br />The exception is imperative. According to para 2 of art.23, any agreement that prevents or restricts the right to free use is null and void, unless otherwise provided by the law."
