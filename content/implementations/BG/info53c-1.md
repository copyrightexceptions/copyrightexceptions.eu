description: "It allows reuse of articles on current economic, political and religious topics solely by way of reproduction and by mass media only.

remarks: "In terms of beneficiaries, no definition or express judicial interpretation of ‘mass media’ is available, but Courts generally include all websites in. 
Although the exception covers reproduction only, all available case law concerns making available by websites and online news providers and no distinction is made by courts between the two types of use. 
The exception covers copyrighted works only. It does not extend to performers (Article 84), phonograms producers (Art. 90), film producers (Art. 90v), and broadcasting organisations (Art. 93). The respective referencing provisions do not reference this particular exception. Possible rationale: While no legal definition of “articles” exists, the constant interpretation suggests that the exception covers literary works exclusively.
Subject matter further limited by case-law: Articles only, but also  – 'articles' must be journalistic and 'creative elements should not prevail' - some articles on current events found 'too' creative to fall under the exception by Courts. 
The indication of both the source and the name of the author are cumulative conditions for the application of the exception.
Very liberal interpretation of the Opt-Out option by Courts - the rightsholder can express their disagreement to free use of their article post factum, by the act of filing a claim for copyright infringement. Opt-out by the publisher is sufficient. No deliberation as to how the publisher exercises the author’s Opt-Out option is available."
