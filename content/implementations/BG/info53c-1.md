remarks: "In terms of beneficiaries, no definition or express a judicial interpretation of ‘mass media’ is available, but Courts generally include all websites in this scope.<br /><br />Before 2023, the exception covered reproduction only and copyrighted works only. Since 2023, the respective referencing provisions for neighbouring rights include references to the entire art. 24. However, the subject matter is further limited by pre-modification case-law, according to which 'articles' must be journalistic and 'creative elements should not prevail'. Some articles on current events were found by Courts 'too' creative to fall under the exception.<br /><br />The indication of both the source and the name of the author are cumulative conditions for the application of the exception.<br /><br />Very liberal interpretation of the Opt-Out option by Courts - the rightsholder can express their disagreement to free use of their article post factum, by the act of filing a claim for copyright infringement. Opt-out by the publisher is sufficient. No deliberation as to how the publisher exercises the author’s Opt-Out option is available.<br /><br />The exception is imperative. According to para 2 of art.23, any agreement that prevents or restricts the right to free use is null and void, unless otherwise provided by the law."
