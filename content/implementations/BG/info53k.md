remarks: "This exception applies to all neighbouring rights.<br /><br />The provision follows the exact scope of the InfoSoc model clause. Possible issue is the translation of the term 'pastiche' as an 'imitation of the character or style of another work'.<br /><br />The exception is imperative. According to para 2 of art.23, any agreement that prevents or restricts the right to free use is null and void, unless otherwise provided by the law."
