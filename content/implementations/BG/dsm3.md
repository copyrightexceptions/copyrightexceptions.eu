In addition, as per the more general norm of para 2 of art.23, any agreement that prevents or restricts the right to free use is null and void, unless otherwise provided by the law. Furthermore, under art.25a, para. 2, 'users who wish to benefit from the provisions of art.26g for works that they have a legal right to use, but are prevented by technical means of protection, may request the right holder to provide them with the relevant access to the extent justified by the purpose. In addition, under art.26k, whenever a user under art. 26g has requested the rightsholder to provide them with access to the protected subject matter under the terms of para 2 of art.25a, the rightsholder shall be obliged to provide the necessary access within 72 hours of receipt of the request.<br /><br />The provision contains a collision norm, stating that the application of this exception does not affect the one of art. 26f (general TDM exception) and is not limited by it. There is also a general collision norm in art.26l, according to which this exception 'shall not affect the application of' the pre-existing exception under art. 24 and 'shall not be limited by them."
