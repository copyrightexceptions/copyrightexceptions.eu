remarks: "In terms of beneficiaries, no definition or express a judicial interpretation of ‘mass media’ is available, but Courts generally include all websites in this scope.<br /><br />Before 2023, the exception extended to performers (art. 84), phonograms producers (art. 90) and film producers (art. 90v), but did not apply to broadcast organisations (art. 93). As of 2023, the respective referencing provisions for neighbouring rights include references to the entire art. 24.<br /><br />According to pre-modification national case law, the hypothesis of art. 24, para. 1, item 6 of the CNRL applies solely to works related to a current event and for the purpose of informing the public about the same event. It is beyond the scope of the provision to use a work from one event to inform about another event.<br /><br />The indication of both the source and the name of the author are cumulative conditions for the application of the exception.<br /><br />The exception is imperative. According to para 2 of art.23, any agreement that prevents or restricts the right to free use is null and void, unless otherwise provided by the law."
