description: "This exception allows reproduction by photographic, cinematographic or analogous means, as well as by sound recording or video recording of works related to a current event, in order for those works to be used by the mass media to a limited extent justified by the purposes of the information, indicating the source and author's name, unless this is impossible."

- informative purpose
usage:
- reproduction by photographic, cinematographic or analogous means, as well as by sound recording or video recording
- use (by mass media to a limited extent)
subjectmatter:
- works (related to a current event)
- performances (related to a current event)
- phonograms (related to a current event)
- film fixations (related to a current event)
compensation:
- no compensation
attribution: 
- indicating the source and author's name is required, unless this is impossible
otherConditions: 
- use to a limited extent justified by the purposes of the information
remarks: "The exception extends to performers (Article 84), phonograms producers (Art. 90) and Film producers (Art. 90v). It does not apply to broadcasting organisations (Art. 93). Possible rationale: exclusive rights and short news reports in television broadcasting are regulated in the Radio and Television Act, where most AVMS Directive transpositions are.
Acording to national case law, the hypothesis of Art. 24, para. 1, item 6 of the CNRL applies solely to works related to a current event and for the purpose of informing the public about the same event. It is beyond the scope of the provision to use a work from one event to inform about another event. The indication of both the source and the name of the author are cumulative conditions for the application of the exception."
