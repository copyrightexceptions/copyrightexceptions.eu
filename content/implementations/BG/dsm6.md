According to the special provision of art.26l, para 2 (implementing art.7 of the CDSM Directive), 'any agreement that prevents or restricts the right to free use under articles 26g - 26i shall be null and void'. In addition, as per the more general norm of para 2 of art.23, any agreement that prevents or restricts the right to free use is null and void, unless otherwise provided by the law. Furthermore, under art.25a, para. 2, 'users who wish to benefit from the provisions of art.26i for works that they have a legal right to use, but are prevented by technical means of protection, may request the right holder to provide them with the relevant access to the extent justified by the purpose.<br /><br />This exception co-exists and fits within the scope of the pre-exissting implementation of art.5.2.c of the InfoSoc Directive (transposed in art.24q para 1, item 9 of the Bulgarian law). There is an unambitious collision norm in art.26l, according to which the new exceptions 'shall not affect the application of' the pre-existing exception under art. 24 and 'shall not be limited by it."
