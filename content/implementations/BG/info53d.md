remarks: "Before 2023, the exception did not extend to performers’ rights (art. 84) and phonogram producers (art. 90). As of 2023, the respective referencing provisions for neighbouring rights include references to the entire art. 24.<br /><br />According to case law, the lack of attribution obstructs the application of the quotation exception.<br /><br />The exception is imperative. According to para 2 of art.23, any agreement that prevents or restricts the right to free use is null and void, unless otherwise provided by the law."
