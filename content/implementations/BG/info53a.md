remarks: "Since 2023, the respective referencing provisions for neighbouring rights include references to the entire art. 24.<br /><br />The exception is imperative. According to para 2 of art.23, any agreement that prevents or restricts the right to free use is null and void, unless otherwise provided by the law.<br /><br />Judicial interpretation available on:<br /><br />- the question of the volume of the use of works in other works, and the purpose and nature of the use (analysis, commentary, or another type of scientific research) - these are factual issues to be resolved by the national court on a case-by-case basis. When the manner and volume of reproduction in question allow the use of the works not only for the purposes of educational activities but also for other activities, such use cannot rely on the exception.<br /><br />- the manner of use and purpose of use within the educational exception are not different hypotheses of free use. Conditions stated in art. 24, para 1, item 3 of the Copyright and Neighboring Rights Act are cumulative. Educational purpose of the use is not enough. There has to be an element of analysis, commentary, or another form of scientific research. Thus, including a work in a collection of works or a chrestomathy does not fall under the educational exception notwithstanding the educational purpose of the use.<br /><br />This exception co-exists and partially overlaps with the implementation of art.5 of the CDSM Directive (transposed in art.26h of the Bulgarian law). There is an unambitious collision norm in art.26l, according to which the new exceptions 'shall not affect the application of' the pre-existing exception under art. 24 and 'shall not be limited by it."
