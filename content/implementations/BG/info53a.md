remarks: "The exception does not extend to performances.
Judicial interpretation available on: 
- the question of the volume of the use of works in other works, and of the purpose and nature of the use (analysis, commentary or other type of scientific research) - these are
factual issues to be resolved by the national court on a case-by-case basis. When the manner and volume of reproduction in question allow the use of the works not only for the
purposes of educational activities, but also of other activities, such use cannot rely on the exception.
- manner of use and purpose of use within the educational exception are not different hypotheses of free use. Conditions stated in Art. 24, para 1, item 3 of the Copyright and
Neighboring Rights Act are cumulative. Educational purpose of the use is not enough. There has to be an element of analysis, commentary or other form of scientific research. Thus,
including a work in a collection of works or a chrestomathy does not fall under the educational exception notwithstanding the educational purpose of the use."
