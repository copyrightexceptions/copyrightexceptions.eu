Since 2023, the word "published" has been replaced by "divulged" and the respective referencing provisions for neighbouring rights include references to the entire art. 24.<br /><br />The exception is imperative. According to para 2 of art.23, any agreement that prevents or restricts the right to free use is null and void, unless otherwise provided by the law."
