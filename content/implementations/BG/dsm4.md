remarks: "This exception is applicable to all neihgbouring rights.<br /><br />Outside the opt-out option as per para 4 of art.26f, the exception is imperative. Under para 2 of art.23, any agreement that prevents or restricts the right to free use is null and void, unless otherwise provided by the law. Furthermore, under art.25a, para. 2, 'users who wish to benefit from the provisions of art.26f for works that they have a legal right to use, but are prevented by technical means of protection, may request the right holder to provide them with the relevant access to the extent justified by the purpose.<br /><br />There is a collision norm that states that the application of this exception does not affect the one of art. 26g (TDM exception for research purposes) and is not limited by it. There is also a general collision norm in art.26l, according to which this exception 'shall not affect the application of' the pre-existing exception under art. 24 and 'shall not be limited by them."
