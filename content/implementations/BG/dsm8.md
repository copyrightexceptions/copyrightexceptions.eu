compensation:
- no compensation required
attribution: 
- the rightholder must be indicated, unless impossible
otherConditions: 
- objects used must be from the permanent archival fund or the permanent collection of the beneficiary
- objects used must be first deemed 'out of commercial circulation' after an 'investigation' where, after making reasonable efforts, it can be assumed in good faith that the work or other subject matter in its entirety is not offered to the public through its usual commercial channels in the same language and in its original form
- beneficiaries must send the Minister of Culture at least 6 months in advance information on the OOCW which they intend to make available to the public
- beneficiaries maintain documentation of the conducted 'investigation' and its results
- the rightsholder may exclude the application of the exception in respect of the relevant subject matter of protection at any time by giving a 6 months’ written notice
- for the exception to kick-in, there has to be no sufficiently representative collective management organization registered for managing the respective use of the respective subject matter
remarks: "According to para 2 of art. 71l, when enjoying the exception, beneficiaries may also use other types of subject matter in ways other than making available to the public through non-commercial websites 'according to the nature of the protected material and to the extent necessary for the purposes'.<br /><br />The exception does not apply to groups of out-of-commerce works and other subject matter which, during the investigation under art. 71m, para. 1, are found to be connected to a third country, unless the CMO is representative of the rightholders from that third country. Whenever the beneficiary is established in Bulgaria, the use shall be deemed to have been carried out on the Bulgarian territory.<br /><br />The exception is imperative. According to para 2 of art.23, any agreement that prevents or restricts the right to free use is null and void, unless otherwise provided by the law.<br /><br />There is a possibility of a formal override through the registration of a representative CMO. The law provides for a registration procedure in which 'sufficiently representative' CMOs are registered as such by means of a one-off act, without any requirements for the assessment of the level of representativeness or for its ongoing monitoring.<br /><br />The provision contains a collision norm. As per para 5 of art.71l, the provisions of art.71 'shall not restrict the exercise of the right to freely use works and other subject matter or parts thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Act'."
