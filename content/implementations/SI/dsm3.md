- storage in a secure environment (with an appropriate level of security) which should be proportionate and limited to what is necessary for the secure storage of copies and the prevention of unauthorised use. An author may take appropriate measures to ensure the security and integrity of networks and databases, but such measures may not be disproportionate and may not prevent the effective use
- in case there are TPMs in place, preventing beneficiaries from making use of the exception, the author must provide access within a time limit not exceeding 72 hours
- making available to the public of the TDM results is permissible, provided that the extent of use is limited by the intended purpose, is compatible with fair practice, does not conflict with normal use of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author
remarks: "Persuant to art.57b(1), text and data mining also includes the digitisation of analogue content.<br /><br />Any contractual stipulation contrary to the exception shall be null and void.<br /><br />According to Article 4 of the CRRA, the provisions on 'the substantive restrictions on copyright' apply mutatis mutandis to related rights, unless otherwise provided in Chapter Five of the Act."
