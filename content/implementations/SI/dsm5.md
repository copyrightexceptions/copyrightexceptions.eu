The use is permitted to the extent of up to 15% of the work, but a photograph, an illustration or a very short work such as a short article may be used in its entirety. The work may not be used in such a way so as to replace its purchase, e.g. by successive reproductions of extracts from the same work. Textbooks, workbooks, exercise books and other teaching materials intended primarily for use in teaching, and graphic editions of musical works, are excluded from the scope of the exception, provided that licences are readily available on the market. In addition, use for illustration for teaching is also available for direct teaching (art.49) without limitation as to the type and volume and without payment of remuneration."
