description: "Slovenia has three separate teaching exceptions for the use of disclosed works and one general research exception. The main implementation or art.5(3)(a) of the InfoSoc Directive can be found in art. 47(1)(1) of the national law and only covers inclusion in textbooks by reproduction. It is a remunerated exception that allows for the reproduction of parts of works and single works of photography, fine arts, architecture, applied art, industrial design and cartography, in readers and textbooks intended for teaching, provided these are already disclosed works of a number of authors. Furthermore, art. 47b implements the provision of art.5 of the CDSM Directive, albeit only regarding digital distance or cross-border teaching and in a very limiting way. It is a remunerated exception, restricted as to the volume of use and types of works and can be overriden by the availablility of licenses. In addition, use for illustration for teaching is also available exclusively for direct teaching (art.49) without limitation as to the type and volume and without payment of remuneration. Finally, art.57c allows for the reproduction and communication to the public in the context of scientific research, and not for direct or indirect economic advantage. The use is limited to up to 15% of a disclosed work in any case, up to 75% in the case of reproduction for the purposes of the author's own scientific research, and is unlimited where a photograph, illustration or a very short work, such as a short article is concerned. The research exception is imperative, any contrary contractual stipulation being null and void."

remarks: "Slovenia's teaching exceptions are very restricted in both scope and applicability. However, the country's relatively broad and imperative general research exception raises the overall implementation score to a medium level.<br /><br />According to Article 4 of the CRRA, the provisions on 'the substantive restrictions on copyright' apply mutatis mutandis to related rights, unless otherwise provided in Chapter Five of the Act."
