Entire books, graphic editions of music works, electronic databases, computer programs and architectural constructions are explicitely excluded from the scope of the exception; except where a written work in the volume of the entire book has been out-of-commerce for at least two years; or graphic editions of a musical works are copied by hand. Since 2022, the transposition of art. 6 of the CDSM Directive has removed these restrictions exclusively for the purpose of cultural heritage preservation."

remarks: "Compensation fees are regulated in a different legislative act - 'Regulation on the amounts of remuneration for private and internal reproduction' of 2006.<br /><br />The pre-existing reproduction exception shares a provision with the reprography and the private copying ones and is cosidered 'reproduction for internal purposes'. It had a low score due to the prohibition of reproduction of entire books and sheet music for the purposes of cultural heritage institutions, notwithstanding the purpose. Since 2022, the transposition of art. 6 of the CDSM Directive has removed these restrictions exclusively for the purpose of cultural heritage preservation.<br /><br />According to Article 4 of the CRRA, the provisions on 'the substantive restrictions on copyright' apply mutatis mutandis to related rights, unless otherwise provided in Chapter Five of the Act."
