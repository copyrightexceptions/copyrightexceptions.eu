remarks: "Poland has one exception covering all types of uses of works for educational purposes or for the purpose of conducting scientific activity (art. 27) and one exception covering all types of uses of subject matter protected by neighbouring rights for the same purposes (Art. 100). These exceptions are subject to the same conditions. Poland implemented art.5 of the CDSM Directive by ammending art.27 in a more restrictive way, limiting beneficiaries and introducing a quantitative limit to the volume of use.<br /><br />The beneficiaries of the exceptions are, explicitly listed in the Act (see Article 7.1 (1), (2), and (4) to (8) of the Act of 20 July 2018 - The Law on Higher Education and Science). They can be public and private entities.<br /><br />The exceptions cover uses of originals and translations of disseminated works. Reproductions are subject to a quantitative limitation: only minor works or up to 25% of larger works can be reproduced. It is not entirely clear whether the quantitative restriction only applies to the reproduction of works or also to other activities (e.g. making works publicly available).<br /><br />The two exceptions are not subject to compensation. They require attribution and are subject to the 3-step test. An interpretation of these provisions indicates that the use may not be commercial.<br /><br /> Under article 100, the exercise of the related rights is subject to the restrictions referred to in Articles 23-35, respectively. The exception does not apply to the use of computer programs (Art. 77 (1))."
