- a work cannot be deemed commercially unavailable if there is a high probability that it will be commercially available in the future (art.35<sup>11</sup>(1))
- the exception only applies if use is 'not possible' due to the lack of a representative collective management organization, and 'the rightholder who holds the economic rights to the work, is not represented by any collective management organization under a collective copyright management agreement or a representation agreement within the meaning of the Act on Collective Management of Copyright and Related Right'
- rightsholders, including licensees of relevant economic rights, can prohibit the use
remarks: "The Polish implementation of the fall-back exception has been gold-plated in an unusually restrictive manner. Firstly, it can be overriden not only by the existance of a representative collective management organization, but also by the existance of an affiliation between the holder of economic rights over a specific work with a CMO. In addition, amongst the information that beneficiaries are required to publish, are: the first name and surname or name of the rightholder who holds the copyright to the work within the fields of exploitation; the first name and surname or name of the producer or publisher of the work and; information on the scope of use of the commercially unavailable work and the territories covered by such use. Needless to say, these requirements undully restrict the applicability of the exception while at the same time creating obligations for beneficiaries to scrupulously examine the copyright and licensing status of individual works, as well as affilliations of potential rightsholders that go far beyond the requirement of 'reasonable effort' pursuant to art.8(5) of the CDSM Directive. Although outside the scope of the exception proper, the formulation of art. 35<sup>11</sup>, which defines the scope of out-of-commerce works, is problematic as well. It combining a minimum 20-year period before a work is considered out of commerce with a requirement that there be no high probability of its future commercial availability. The logic underlying the identification of out-of-commerce works is likewise undermined, as art. 35<sup>12</sup> requires the exclusion of a 'signifcant probability’ that the work may be commercially available. In procedural terms, the Minister of Culture may deny an entity’s registration in the OOCW Portal if the intended use is considered to fall outside the scope of the activities of the cultural heritage institution as specified in its statute."
