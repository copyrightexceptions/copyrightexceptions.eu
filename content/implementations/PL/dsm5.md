remarks: "Poland implemented art.5 of the CDSM Directive by ammending the existing implementation of art.5.3.a. of the InfoSoc Directive in art.27 of the Law, in a more restrictive way, limiting beneficiaries and introducing a quantitative limit to the volume of use. It also integrated the country-of-origin principle to cross-border situations (art.27(2)).<br /><br />The beneficiaries of the exceptions are, explicitly listed in the Act (see Article 7.1 (1), (2), and (4) to (8) of the Act of 20 July 2018 - The Law on Higher Education and Science). They can be public and private entities.<br /><br />The exceptions cover uses of originals and translations of disseminated works. Reproductions are subject to a quantitative limitation: only minor works or up to 25% of larger works can be reproduced. It is not entirely clear whether the quantitative restriction only applies to the reproduction of works or also to other activities (e.g. making works publicly available).<br /><br />The exception is not subject to compensation.<br /><br />It appears that there is no explicit provision safeguarding the mandatory nature of the exception.<br /><br />Article 34 of the Act sets a general obligation to name the author and the source, subject to existing options, in order to use the works within the limits of permissible free use. Authors do not have the right to remuneration, unless stipulated otherwise.<br /><br />Under article 100, the exercise of related rights is subject to the restrictions referred to in Articles 23-35, respectively."
