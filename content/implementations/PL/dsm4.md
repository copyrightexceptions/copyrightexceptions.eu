otherConditions: 
- use can be reserved by a rightsholder's notice, made expressly and appropriately to the manner in which the work has been made available (in the case of works made publicly available in such a way that anyone can access them at a place and time of their choosing, the notice shall be made in a machine-readable format within the meaning of Art. 2 item 7 of the Act of August 11, 2021, on Open Data and the Reuse of Public Sector Information (Journal of Laws of 2023, item 1524), together with metadata)

remarks: "Art. 34 of the Act sets a general obligation to name the author and the source, subject to existing options, in order to use the works within the limits of permissible free use. Authors do not have the right to remuneration, unless stipulated otherwise.<br /><br />Under art. 100, the exercise of related rights is subject to the restrictions referred to in arts. 23-35, respectively. Sui generis database rights are regulated in a separate act.<br /><br />For the sake of comprehensiveness, it should be noted that the initial Polish transposition proposal of February 2024 provided for an explicit exclusion of AI training from the scope of TDM for the implementation of both articles 3 and 4 of the Directive. This carve-out, however, was not retained in the final amendment."
