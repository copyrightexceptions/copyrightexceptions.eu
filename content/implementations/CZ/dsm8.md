remarks: "The application of the exception appears to be contingent on the existence of a CMO for the relevant type of works, without any requirement that it be 'sufficiently representative' within the meaning of the Directive (see also §97e(4)(m) of the Law).<br /><br />Pursuant to §29(2), works used must be disclosed.<br /><br />§29(3) contains a general provision regarding the imperative nature of exceptions. It states that 'any legal act that excludes or limits copyright exceptions or limitations shall be disregarded, unless the law provides otherwise'.<br /><br />The exception extends to performers' (§ 74), phonogram producers' (§ 78), film producers' (§ 82), broadcasters' (§ 86) and press publishers' rights (§87b(7))."
