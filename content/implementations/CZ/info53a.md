score: 2
description: Czechia has a general exception allowing any uses of protected materials in teaching or in scientific research (§31(1)(c)) and one exception allowing any uses of protected materials in school performances (§35(2)). Both exceptions are open to all users and none is subject to compensation.
beneficiaries:
- any users
purposes: 
- teaching for illustration, with no direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit
- scientific research, with no direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit
- use in school performances in which pupils, students or teachers of a school or educational establishment perform exclusively
usage:
- any uses
subjectmatter:
- works
- performances
- sound recordings
- film fixations
- broadcasts
compensation:
- does not require the payment of compensation
attribution: 
- no attribution required
otherConditions: 
- "quantitative limitations: does not exceed the scope of the intended purpose (general exception)"
- "3-step test: uses of works must not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author"
- the exceptions do not apply to press publications
remarks: Neither of the two exceptions in §31(1)(c) and §35(2) of the Copyright Act apply to press publications (§87b(7)). In addition to §31(1)(c), art. 5 of the CDSM Directive was implemented in parallel, in a provision covering 'licensing for digital teaching', which partially overlaps with the scope of §31(1)(c). It covers digital uses only, solely for educational institutions, and there is a very broadly worded carve-out for the use of works primarily intended for educational purposes and of published sheet music of musical or musical-dramatic works, without conditioning its application on the availability of appropriate licences.<br /><br />The exception extends to performers' (§ 74), phonogram producers' (§ 78), film producers' (§ 82), broadcasters' (§ 86) rights.
