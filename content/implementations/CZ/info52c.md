remarks: "In 2022, with the implementation of art.6 of the CDSM directive, the provision of §37(1)a was amended as to remove the requirement for the use to be limited to cases where the initial copy is damaged or lost.<br /><br />§29(3) contains a general provision regarding the imperative nature of exceptions. It states that 'any legal act that excludes or limits copyright exceptions or limitations shall be disregarded, unless the law provides otherwise'. Furthermore, under §43(6), the legal protection against circumvention of TPMs does not affect the exception to the extent necessary for its use. An author who has used technical means is obliged to make their work available to authorized users to the extent necessary to fulfill the purpose of said use.<br /><br />The exception extends to performers' (§ 74), phonogram producers' (§ 78), film producers' (§ 82), broadcasters' (§ 86) and press publishers' rights (§87b(7))."
