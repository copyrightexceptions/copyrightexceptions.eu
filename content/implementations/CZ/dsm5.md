remarks: "Art. 5 of the CDSM Directive was implemented in a provision covering 'licensing for digital teaching'. It existists in parallel and partially overlaps with the scope of §31(1)(c) of the Law, that covers a general 'illustration for teaching and research' exception.<br /><br />There is a very broadly worded carve-out for the use of works primarily intended for educational purposes and of published sheet music of musical or musical-dramatic works, without conditioning its application on the availability of appropriate licences.<br /><br />Pursuant to §29(2), works used must be disclosed.<br /><br />§29(3) contains a general provision regarding the imperative nature of exceptions. It states that 'any legal act that excludes or limits copyright exceptions or limitations shall be disregarded, unless the law provides otherwise'.<br /><br />The exception extends to performers' (§ 74), phonogram producers' (§ 78), film producers' (§ 82), broadcasters' (§ 86) and press publishers' rights (§87b(7))."
