description: "Spanish law contains several partially overlapping exceptions for the purposes of teaching and research. Art. 32(2) of Law 23/2006 allows for the inclusion of fragments of other works of a written, audio, or audiovisual nature, as well as isolated works of a figurative, plastic or photographic nature, in a work of one's own, provided that they are works that have already been disseminated and their inclusion is made by way of quotation or for analysis, commentary or critical judgement, for teaching or research purposes. In addition, teachers in formal education and staff of universities and public research organisations can carry out acts of reproduction, distribution and communication to the public of small fragments of works and of isolated works of a figurative plastic or photographic character (except for textbooks, university manuals or equivalent publications, musical scores, single-use works, and compilations or groupings of fragments of works, or of isolated works of a figurative plastic or photographic character), solely for the illustration of educational activities, both in face-to-face and distance learning, or for scientific research purposes, and to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose pursued (art.32(4) of Law 23/2006). In addition, the implementation of art.5 of the CDSM Directive from 2021 allows for the reproduction, distribution, and public communication within the same frame, but exclusively by digital means in a secure electronic environment (art.68 of Royal Decree-Law 24/2021). Finally, para 5 of art.32 of Law 23/2006 allows for the reproduction, distribution and communication to the public (solely among students and teaching or research staff), by universities or public research centres, by their staff and using their own means and instruments, for the purpose of illustration for educational or scientific research purposes, of works or publications, printed or capable of being printed. In this case use is limited to one chapter of a book, one article of a journal, or an equivalent extent in the case of an equivalent publication, or to an extent equivalent to 10% of the total work, irrespective of whether the copying is carried out through one or several acts of reproduction. Both exceptions under paras 4 and 5 of art.32 of Law 23/2006 require a non-waivable equitable remuneration from the user institutions, to be collected through collective management organisations."

remarks: "Prior to the transposition of the InfoSoc Directive, the educational and research exception was effectively fused with the quotation exception. Free use for the purposes of illustration for teaching and research has been expanded on in a separate provision (art. 32, paras 3 and 4 of the Law). Both paras 4 and 5 are relatively restrictive and require a non-waivable equitable remuneration from the user institutions, to be collected through collective management organisations.<br /><br />The exceptions apply to neighbouring rights on the basis of the general provision of Art. 132 of the Law. However, the transposition of the CDSM Directive in 2021 was effected by Royal Decree-Law 24/2021, enacted as a standalone legislative text functioning in parallel to the Intellectual Property Law. As a result, this exception is regulated separately from the pre-existing exceptions in art.32 of the Intellectual Property Law. Also, the general rule laid down in Article 132 of the Intellectual Property Law, which provides for the horizontal application of exceptions to all neighbouring rights, does not apply for the digital IfT exception. Although art.68 explicitly mentions works and 'other content', it remains unclear if the exception applies to the press publishers' right (see García Vidal, Á. (2021, noviembre). La propiedad intelectual en el Real Decreto Ley 24/2021, de 2 de noviembre. GA-P. <https://ga-p.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Propiedad_Intelectual_Real_Decreto_Ley.pdf>). Furthermore, the legislation contains no express rule preventing the exceptions from being contractually overridden."
