description: "The exception in art. 39 of Law 23/2006 allows for transformation of disclosed works by way of parody, as long as it does not imply a risk of confusion with the original work or infer damage to the original work or its author. With the implementation of the CDSM Directive, Spain also introduced - in a separate law - use for the purpose of 'transformation of a disclosed work by taking certain characteristic elements from an artist's work and combining them in such a way as to give the impression of being an independent creation'."

remarks: "The transposition of the CDSM Directive was effected by Royal Decree-Law 24/2021, enacted as a standalone legislative text functioning in parallel to the Intellectual Property Law. As a result, there are now two separate exceptions for parody and pastiche in Spanish law.<br /><br />In terms of the purposes of use, the pre-existing exception in art. 39 of Law 23/2006 does not cover caricature and pastiche. It applies to neighbouring rights on the basis of the general provision of art. 132 of the Law. On the other hand, the exception introduced in 2021 solely covers pastiche. Unlike the parody exception, it adds no further requirements or limitations for the use. It is also not limited to use on online platforms. However, a possible issue is the rather detailed translation of the term 'pastiche' as 'transformation of a disclosed work by taking certain characteristic elements from an artist's work and combining them in such a way as to give the impression of being an independent creation.' In this case, the general rule laid down in art. 132 of the Intellectual Property Law, which provides for the horizontal application of exceptions to all neighbouring rights, does not apply to the pastiche exception. This means that the Spanish pastiche exception applies only to copyrighted works.<br /><br />Lastly, commentators view both exceptions as lacking in scope in terms of the types of use, as they only cover transformation. It is unclear whether they extend to acts of subsequent communication to the public of the derivative work, since under art. 21(1) of Law 23/2006 such acts fall within the discretion of the original author (see García Vidal, Á. (2021, noviembre). La propiedad intelectual en el Real Decreto Ley 24/2021, de 2 de noviembre. GA-P. <https://ga-p.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Propiedad_Intelectual_Real_Decreto_Ley.pdf>)."
