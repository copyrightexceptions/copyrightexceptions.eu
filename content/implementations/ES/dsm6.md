description: "This exception allows cultural heritage institutions (as well as third parties acting on their behalf and under their responsibility) to make reproductions of works or other items permanently held in their collections, using appropriate conservation tools, means, or technologies, in any format or medium, in the necessary quantity, at any time during the life of a work or other item, and to the extent necessary for conservation purposes." 
beneficiaries:
- cultural heritage institutions
- third parties acting on CHIs' behalf and under their responsibility
- legitimate database users
purposes: 
- conservation
usage:
- reproduction
subjectmatter:
- works
- databases
- other items
compensation:
- no compensation required
attribution: 
- no attribution required
otherConditions: 
- works must be permanently held in beneficiaries' collections (this does not apply to databases, which can be reproduced under the exception if they are publicly available or if the user has lawful access)
- use must be effected with the appropriate conservation tools, means, or technologies
- use must be limited to the extent necessary for conservation purposes
remarks: "The exception explicitely applies to publicly available databases (para 3). It also extends to legitimate users of a database, regardless of how the latter has been disseminated. Such legitimate users can reproduce a substantial part of the databases' content, when it is for the purpose of preserving cultural heritage in accordance with Article 37 of the consolidated text of the Intellectual Property Law.<br /><br />The transposition of the CDSM Directive was effected by Royal Decree-Law 24/2021, enacted as a standalone legislative text functioning in parallel to the Intellectual Property Law. As a result, this exception is regulated separately from the pre-existing CHI reproduction exception in art.37(1) of Law 23/2006. Also, the general rule laid down in Article 132 of the Intellectual Property Law, which provides for the horizontal application of exceptions to all neighbouring rights, does not apply. Although art.69 explicitly mentions works and 'other items', it remains unclear if the exception applies to the press publishers' right (see García Vidal, Á. (2021, noviembre). La propiedad intelectual en el Real Decreto Ley 24/2021, de 2 de noviembre. GA-P. <https://ga-p.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Propiedad_Intelectual_Real_Decreto_Ley.pdf>).<br /><br />The legislation contains no express rule preventing the exceptions from being contractually overridden."
