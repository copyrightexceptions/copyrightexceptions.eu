It also includes 'total or partial reproduction, by any means and in any form, whether permanent or temporary. However, when distribution or public communication of the work or performance requires such reproduction, authorization from the copyright holder is required.

otherConditions: 
- works must be permanently held in the institutions' collections (except for databases, publicly available databases being covered as well)
- for the exception to kick-in, there should not be a sufficiently representative collective management organization for intellectual property rights
- where the distribution or communication to the public of the work or subject matter requires reproduction, authorisation must be obtained for such reproduction from the rightholder
remarks: "The exception explicitly applies to publicly available databases (para 7). It also extends to legitimate users of a database, regardless of how the latter has been disseminated (para 9). Such legitimate users can extract and/or reuse a substantial part of databases' content when making out-of-commerce works available.<br /><br />The transposition of the CDSM Directive was effected by Royal Decree-Law 24/2021, enacted as a standalone legislative text functioning in parallel to the Intellectual Property Law. As a result, the general rule laid down in Article 132 of the Intellectual Property Law, which provides for the horizontal application of exceptions to all neighbouring rights, does not apply. Art.71 explicitly mentions works, databases and 'performances', but the exception appears not to apply to any other neighbouring rights.<br /><br />There appears to be no option for the author to opt out of the use."
