remarks: "The transposition of the CDSM Directive was effected by Royal Decree-Law 24/2021, enacted as a standalone legislative text functioning in parallel to the Intellectual Property Law. As a result, this exception is regulated separately from the pre-existing teaching exception in art.32 of the Intellectual Property Law. Also, the general rule laid down in Article 132 of the Intellectual Property Law, which provides for the horizontal application of exceptions to all neighbouring rights, does not apply. Although art.68 explicitly mentions works and 'other content', it remains unclear if the exception applies to the press publishers' right (see García Vidal, Á. (2021, noviembre). La propiedad intelectual en el Real Decreto Ley 24/2021, de 2 de noviembre. GA-P. <https://ga-p.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Propiedad_Intelectual_Real_Decreto_Ley.pdf>). Furthermore, the legislation contains no express rule preventing the exceptions from being contractually overridden."
