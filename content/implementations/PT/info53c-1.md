remarks: "Until 2023 the scope of art. 75(2)(c) was neutral and broad. With the implementation of the CDSM Directive that scope was seriosly resticted to non-commercial uses only (thus excluding news aggregators and media monitoring agencies, but also most mass media from the scope of beneficiaries of the press review exception). Still, the scope of the provision in art. 75(2)(m), which follows precisely the model-clause of art. 5(3)(c), part 1, of the InfoSoc Directive, remained unchanged.<br /><br />The exception applies mutatis mutandis to neighbouring rights under art. 189(3) of the Copyright code. Also under 189(1)(b), excerpts from a performance, a phonogram, a videogram or a broadcast, provided that the use of such excerpts is justified for the purposes of information or [...] summaries referred to in Article 75(2)(g), is exempted from protection by related rights.<br /><br />Indication of source is mandatory in Portugal for all exceptions. Under art. 76º n.º1 (a), the free use referred to in the previous article must be accompanied by the indication, whenever possible, of the name of the author and editor, the title of the work and other circumstances that identify them."
