remarks: "There are 3 exceptions in the Portuguese law that implement Art. 5.3(a) InfoSoc.: two cover the use of copyright-protected works (Art. 75(2)(f) and (g)) and one covers the use of subject matter protected by neighbouring rights under the InfoSoc (i.e. performances, phonograms, film fixations and broadcasts) (Art. 189(1)(c)).<br /><br />The exception that applies to subject matter protected by neighbouring rights covers uses both for educational and scientific purposes, whereas the exceptions that apply to copyright-protected works do not cover scientific purposes.<br /><br /> The exception that applies to subject matter protected by neighbouring rights covers any uses. The main exception permitting the use of copyright-protected works covers reproduction, distribution and making available to the public for teaching purposes (Art. 75(2)(f)); the other allows the inclusion of works for purposes of creating teaching materials (Art. 75(2)(h)).<br /><br />The exceptions that allow the use of copyright-protected works (Art. 75(2)(f) and (g)) are conditioned to the use of parts of works, but one of them (Art. 75(2)(h)) allows the use of short works in their entirety. The exception that applies to subject matter protected by neighbouring rights does not restrict the portion to which a material can be used. The main exception permitting the use of copyright-protected works (Art. 75(2)(f)) is conditioned to uses that are exclusively related to the teaching objectives in the “establishments” (implying that the exception only covers formal activities, but without specifying which establishments are those) and that do not aim to obtain, directly or indirectly, an economic or commercial advantage. The other two exceptions do not have any such limitations.<br /><br />The exceptions that permit the use of copyright-protected works (Art. 75(2)(f) and (g)) are subject to the 3-step test. The exception that applies to subject matter protected by neighbouring rights does not have any such limitation. The exception that covers the creation of teaching materials (Art. 75(2)(h)) is the only one that is subject to compensation."
