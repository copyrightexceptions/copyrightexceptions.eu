At the same time, art. 74º-D sets a cut-off date that appears to be a cumulative.<br /><br/>The opt-out mechanism is regulated in paras 5 to 7 of Article 36º-A of Law No.º 26/2015, referenced by art. 74-D, para 2(b) of the Copyright act.<br /><br/>The exception applies mutatis mutandis to neighbouring rights under art. 189(3) of the Copyright code."
