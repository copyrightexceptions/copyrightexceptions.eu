remarks: "In 2023 the exception was amended to incorporate the implementation of art.6 of the CDSM Directive. Reproduction for preservation purposes was retreaved in a stand-alone first paragraph, covering a broader range of beneficiaries, while the previous wording of the exception was left in para 2 et seq. for purposes other than preservation.<br /><br />The exception enbles its benefifciaries to digitise works for the purpose of digital lending, however the lending itself falls outside the scope of the provision and is governed by an extending collective licensing scheme as per art. 42d of the Law.<br /><br />The exception extends to the rights of performers (art. 45(3) of the Law), photographers (art. 49a(4) of the Law), phonograms and film producers (art. 46(3) of the Law), broadcasting organisations (art. 48(3) of the Law), database makers (art. 49(3) of the Law) and press publishers (art. 48b(4) of the Law).<br /><br />Art. 11(2) requires that when a work is used publicly under an exception, the source must be, as a general rule, stated to the extent and in the manner required by proper usage. It also requires that the work must not be altered more than necessary for the intended use."
