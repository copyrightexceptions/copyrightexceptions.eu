description: "The exceptions for teaching and research in Denmark are very narrow. § 13a is a limited implementation of art.5 of the CDSM Directive, allowing for the reproduction and making available for illustration in teaching, under the responsibility of an educational institution on premises or via secure digital environments, provided that the use is non-commercial. This exception is remunerated and only applies if no suitable extended collective licensing scheme exists. § 23(1) is the pre-existing transposition of art.5.3.a of the InfoSoc Directive that only covers the reproduction of published works of art and works of a descriptive nature in critical or scientific presentations in connection with the text, when this is done for non-commercial purposes, in accordance with good practice and to the extent required by the purpose."

remarks: "In Denmark, the default regime for the permitted use for educational purposes is extended collective licensing. Art.5 of the CDSM Directive is implemented in a fall-back exception for cases where no suitable licence exists, regardless of the subject matter concerned. Also, this exception is remunerated - the author is entitled to fair compensation unless harm is minimal. The exception applies also to performances (§65(6)), sound recordings (§66(2)), film fixations (§67(2)), broadcasts (§69(3)), photographic pictures (§70(3)) and press publications (§ 69a(5) of the CA - added with the amendment of 3 June 2021).<br /><br />As for the use in critical or scientific presentations - the exception in § 23(1) is not remunerated, but with a very narrow scope. It also does not extend to any neighbouring rights.The exception also applies to performances (§65(6)), sound recordings (§66(2)), film fixations (§67(2)), broadcasts (§69(3)), photographic pictures (§70(3)) and press publications (§ 69a(5) of the CA - added with the amendment of 3 June 2021).”
