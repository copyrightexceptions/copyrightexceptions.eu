description: "This exception allows for public archives, public libraries and other libraries that are financed in whole or in part by the public, as well as state museums and museums approved under the Museums Act, to reproduce and distribute copies of works (except for computer programs in digital form) for use in their activities, provided that this is not done for commercial purposes. Specifically for security and protection purposes, these beneficiaries, together with film or sound heritage institutions, may produce copies, including of computer programs in digital form, this clause being non-overridable by contract. In addition, if a copy in an institution’s collection is incomplete, the institution may make copies of the missing parts, unless the work can be acquired through general trade or from the publisher. Beneficiaries can use and distribute said copies in their activities if this is not done for commercial purposes."

otherConditions: 
- where a copy in an institution’s collection is incomplete or missing, the exception can be used to 'completed' it, unless the work can be acquired through general trade or from the publisher
- the general reproduction exception does not apply to computer programs in digital form, except for computer games
- the exception for preservation purposes in para 2 has no restrictions in terms of subject matter
remarks: "The use under the exception was somewhat broadened in 2023 with the implementation of art.5 of the CDSM Directive in para 2 of § 16, which introduced a technology neutral clause for preservation purposes, with no restrictions in terms of subject matter. For other types of reproduction, while not expressly stated, the provision of §16(1) seems to cover analogue reproduction only, since some instances of digital reproduction are subject to collective licensing as per §16b, according to which 'Public libraries and other libraries financed in whole or in part by the public authorities may upon request in digital form reproduce articles from newspapers, magazines and composite works, brief excerpts of books and other published literary works, as well as illustrations and music reproduced in connection with the text, provided the requirements regarding the extended collective license according to section 50 have been met'.<br /><br />The exception applies also to performances (§65(6)), sound recordings (§66(2)), film fixations (§67(2)), broadcasts (§69(3)), photographic pictures (§70(3)) and press publications (§ 69a(5) of the CA - added with the amendment of 3 June 2021)."
