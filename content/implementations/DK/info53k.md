remarks: "Until 2021 no parody exception existed in Denmark. With the amendment of 3 June 2021 an exception was implemented strictly in the scope of art. 17(7) of the CDSM Directive. The exception in §52c(10) allowed for users of online content-sharing services to upload and make available on the online content-sharing services user-generated content containing works and objects to neighbouring rights for the purposes of caricature, parody or pastiche.<br /><br />This exception was not revisited with the later implementation of the exceptions of the CDSM Directive in 2023. However, in 2024, as a result of the development of the so-called Little Mermaid case, Denmark introduced, in a new §24b, a broader parody exception, formulated in a more technology neutral manner, while §52c(10) was repealed in its entirity. Pursuant to §24b(2), the right to claim authorship of the work and the right to object to any derogatory action concerning the work, i.e. the moral rights, are expressly not applicable to a parody. According to §11(2) of the CA, where a work is used in accordance with an exception, the work may not be altered more extensively than is required for the permitted use. If the work is used publicly, the source shall be indicated in accordance with the requirements of proper usage.<br /><br />The exception applies also to performances (§65(6)), sound recordings (§66(2)), film fixations (§67(2)), broadcasts (§69(3)), photographic pictures (§70(3)) and press publications (§ 69a(5) of the CA).<br /><br />For the history of the parody exception, incl. more information on Danish case law on the subject and policy considerations on the national level, see IRIS 2024-7:1/17 (https://merlin.obs.coe.int/article/10108)."
