remarks: "Together with the <a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0035690/2014-10-29\">decision on diligent examination of orphan works from 29 December 2014</a>, these articles implement the 2012 orphan works directive into Dutch Law. Beneficiaries may generate income from reproduction and making available provided that such income is used exclusively to offset the costs of digitizing and making available.<br /><br />Article 17 Auteurswet contains a special provision for public media institutions, which are only allowed to use works that have been identified as orphan works if these works have been produced by the public media institution before 1 January 2003 and have been archived."
