Furthermore, §42(6) allows reproduction by schools, universities and other educational institutions for their own school use and to the extent justified by it. In both cases, reproduction by means other than reprography is only permitted for non-commercial purposes. The exception does not apply to entire books and entire periodicals, as well as to copies thereof, unless copies are made by way of transcription. However, the exception does cover reproduction of entire works when the latter are unpublished or out-of-print. In cultural heritage institutions' case, the exception also excludes sheet music, while in educational establishmets' case it does not cover works, which, by their nature and description, are intended for use in school or teaching."
