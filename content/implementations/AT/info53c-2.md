remarks: "The exceptions and/or limitations in Austrian copyright law are formulated as 'free uses' of works and other subject matter. The exception applies to phonograms (§76(4)) and broadcasts (§76a(3)) but does not apply to photographs (§74(7)) or performances (§71(1)).<br /><br />In addition to Section 42c, Section 42a can also be used for the purpose of reporting current events, especially by media monitoring providers, as it applies not only to works perceivable during the event, but also to the news coverage itself. Under §42a (into force as of November 1, 2013) reproduction for a third-party's own use (unlike 'private use', 'own use' includes 'professional use' within the internal organisation of a legal entity) is also permitted by digital means against remuneration."
