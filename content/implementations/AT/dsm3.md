Cultural heritage institutions are publicly accessible libraries or museums, archives, or institutions active in the field of film or sound heritage (§ 42, para 7);
- beneficiaries have the right to store and retain TDM results subject to appropriate security precautions, provided this is justified by the research purpose, including the verification of scientific findings. A security precaution is considered appropriate if its use has been recognized as best practice by representative associations of rights holders on the one hand, and by research institutions or cultural heritage institutions on the other;

remarks: "The exception applies to photographs and cinematographic products (§74(7)), performances (§71(6)), phonograms (§76(4)), broadcasts (§76a(3)), sui generis database rights (§76d(5)), press publications (§76f(5)).<br /><br />The exception is imperative. This does not preclude the application of measures intended to guarantee the security and integrity of the networks and databases in which the works or other protected subject matter are stored, provided that these restrictions do not exceed what is necessary to achieve this objective. Such restrictions are considered appropriate if they have been recognized as best practice by representative associations of rights holders on the one hand, and by research institutions or cultural heritage institutions on the other (para 5 of § 42h). In addition, in terms of TPM, there is an obligation for holders to 'immediately' provide access to works, insofar as beneficiaries have lawful access to the subject matter, so they can make use of the exception to the required extent."
