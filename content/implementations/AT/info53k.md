It explicitly refers to § 18c of the Law, entitled ‘Delivery and provision by providers of large online platforms’.<br /><br />Related rights provisions do not reference §42f. See: photographs (§74(7)), performances (§71(1)), phonograms (§76(4)), broadcasts (§76a(3)). Section 76f(5) provides for a general application to press publishers' rights.<br /><br />Furthermore, under para 3a of §57, the source, including the name of the author, must be indicated, unless this proves impossible."
