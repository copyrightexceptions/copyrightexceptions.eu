Under art. 134 they apply by analogy to broadcasting organizations.<br /><br />Although there is no restriction to beneficiaries, the EU Court of Justice has interpreted the InfoSoc provision as meaning that free use may be exercised solely by a competent public authority and, in certain cases, by a third party only in coordination with competent national authorities (Painer, Case C-145/10)."
