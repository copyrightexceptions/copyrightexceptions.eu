remarks: "The implementation of the CDSM Directive substituted the preexisting transposition of art.5.3.a of the InfoSoc Directive. Until 2023, the opportunities that CHIs had for reproduction were extremely limited. The pre-existing text of art.23(1) allowed librares, archives or museums to make one copy of a work existing in their permanent collection by means of reproduction, without a direct or indirect commercial purpose, in order to preserve it or to replace a work from the permanent collection of the relevant or any other library, archive or museum if such work has been damaged or has become unusable on the condition that it is not possible to obtain a copy in some other acceptable manner, and the reproduction is repeated in separate and mutually unrelated cases. Only such works that have been published in Latvia and were not available commercially were permitted to be reproduced in a digital format, unless an agreement with the author determines otherwise.<br /><br/>The exception extends to neighbouring rights as per Section 54, para 2 of the CA.<br /><br/>It appears that Latvian law contains neither specific nor general safeguards against the contractual override of the exception."
