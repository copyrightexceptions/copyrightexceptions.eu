remarks: "There is a general education exception covering uses of copyrighted works (Article 19(1) 2) and Article 21) as well as uses of performances, phonograms, film fixations, broadcasts and press publications (Article 54(3) 2)). In addition, there is a specific education exception applicable to the extraction and re-utilization of databases protected by the sui generis right, which is subject to the conditions set forth in the general education exception (Article 59(1) 2)). <br /> The education exceptions cover both digital and non-digital uses, to the extent necessary for the non-commercial purpose to be achieved, without compensation. Anyone can benefit from the education exceptions, except in the case of distance uses, where only students and persons implementing the educational program are allowed to access the secured electronic environment where the use must take place. The provision clarifies that “illustration for in the educational process” means uses that support, enrich or supplement the learning process, in accordance with recital 21 of the CDSM Directive. It further clarifies the meaning of “secured electronic environment”, in line with recital 22 of the CDSM Directive. Furthermore, it goes a step further than the EU lawmaker in terms of cross-border uses, by creating a legal presumption that Latvia is the location to be considered when an educational institution is not established in the European Union or the European Economic Area, but operates in Latvia and implements a curriculum on the subject Latvian Studies."
