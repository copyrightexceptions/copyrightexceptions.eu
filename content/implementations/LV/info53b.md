The exception extends to neighbouring rights as per Section 54(2)2 of the CA 'Restrictions on Rights of the Neighbouring Rightholders'. Unlike the Marrakesh exception, this one does not apply to sui generis database rights as per Section 59(1)5.<br /><br/>The exception extends to neighbouring rights as per Section 54, para 3.2 of the CA"
