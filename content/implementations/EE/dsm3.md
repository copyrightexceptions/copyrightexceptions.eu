For the purposes of the Act, ‘a research organisation’ means a legal person or institution that meets the conditions specified in subsection 1 of § 16 of the Organisation of Research and Development and Innovation Act, including a university and its libraries, as well as a research institute or any other entity, the primary goal of which is to conduct scientific research or to carry out educational activities involving also the conduct of scientific research, doing it on a not-for-profit basis or by reinvesting all the profits in its scientific research, or pursuant to a public interest mission in such a way that the access to the results generated by such scientific research cannot be enjoyed on a preferential basis by an undertaking that exercises a decisive influence upon such organisation. A ‘cultural heritage institution’ means a publicly accessible library or museum, an archive or a film or audio heritage institution.<br /><br />The exception is extended to related rights with a general reference to "other cases where the rights of authors of works are limited pursuant to Chapter IV of this Act" in § 75 (6)."
