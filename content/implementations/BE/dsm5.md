remarks: "There is an exception aimed at implementing article 5 of the DSM Directive (Art. XI.191/1 8.º) allowing the reproduction of works (with the exception of musical scores), or the communication to the public of works in the context of their digital use for the purposes of illustration for teaching, provided that the use is justified by the non-profit aim pursued, and provided that such use takes place under the responsibility of an educational establishment, on its premises or in other places, or by means of a secure electronic environment accessible only to students or students and teaching staff of this institution. It should be noted that the exclusion of the reproduction of musical scores from the scope of protection of the exception does not depend on the market availability of licenses for such materials, which contradicts article 5(2) of the DSM Directive. The use of works for purposes of illustration for teaching carried out by means of secure electronic environments is deemed to take place only in the Member State in which the establishment of teaching is established. Similar exceptions exist for copyrighted databases (Art. XI.191/2 4.º) and for performances, phonograms, film fixations, broadcasts and press publications (Art. XI.217/1 7.º). Likewise, an exception with similar conditions applies to the exclusive rights over computer programs (Art. XI.299 §6) and databases protected by the sui generis database right (Art. XI.310 §4). <br />
In addition, there are other exceptions in Belgium law which partially overlap with the uses covered by article 5 of the DSM Directive, which are described below. <br />
There’s an exception (Art. XI.191/1 3.º) allowing reproduction of works, with the exception of musical scores, for the purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, provided that the use is justified by the non-profit aim pursued. Similar exceptions exist for copyrighted databases (Art. XI.191/2 1.º) and for performances, phonograms, film fixations, broadcasts and press publications (Art. XI.217/1 3.º). <br />
There is an exception (Art. XI.191/1 4.º) allowing the communication to the public of works for the purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, by establishments recognized or officially organized for this purpose by the public authorities and provided that this communication is justified by the purpose not profit pursued, is within the framework of the normal activities of the establishment and is secured by appropriate measures. Similar exceptions exist for copyrighted databases (Art. XI.191/2 2.º) and for performances, phonograms, film fixations, broadcasts and press publications (Art. XI.217/1 4.º). <br />
There is an exception (Art. XI.191/1 6.º) allowing the reproduction or communication to the public of works by childcare establishments recognized or officially organized for this purpose by the public authorities and insofar as this reproduction or communication to the public is within the framework the educational activities of these establishments. Similar exceptions exist for performances, phonograms, film fixations, broadcasts and press publications (Art. XI.217/1 5.º). <br />"
