remarks: "Up to 2022, this exception was limited to the reproduction of a 'certain number of copies' depending on, and for the purpose of, preserving the cultural and scientific heritage. The exception was only available to beneficiaries who did not seek any direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage, and for use that is strictly non-commercial. In addition, use was not to prejudice the normal exploitation of the work or unduly harm the legitimate interests of the author. With the implementation of the CDSM Directive, the scope of the exception was broadened to match that of art. 6 of the Directive. However, use is still only available for the purposes of preservation, which is a significant restriction compared to the scope of use under the InfoSoc model clause.<br /><br/>As per art. XI.217, 11° CEL the exception is also applicable to performers' (art. XI.205.1 § 1 CEL); film producers' (art. XI.209.1 CEL); phonogram producers' (art. XI.213 CEL), broadcasters' (art. XI.215.1 CEL) and press publishers' (art. XI.216/2 CEL) rights.<br /><br/>As per art.XI.193 CEL, all Belgian exceptions are of mandatory nature."
