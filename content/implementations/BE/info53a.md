Similar exceptions exist for copyrighted databases (Art. XI.191/2 1.º) and for performances, phonograms, film fixations, broadcasts and press publications (Art. XI.217/1 3.º). <br />
There is an exception (Art.

Similar exceptions exist for copyrighted databases (Art. XI.191/2 2.º) and for performances, phonograms, film fixations, broadcasts and press publications (Art. XI.217/1 4.º). <br />
There is an exception (Art.

There is an exception aimed at implementing article 5 of the DSM Directive (Art.

It should be noted that the exclusion of the reproduction of musical scores from the scope of protection of the exception does not depend on the market availability of licences for such materials, which contradicts article 5(2) of the DSM Directive. The use of works for purposes of illustration for teaching carried out by means of secure electronic environments is deemed to take place only in the Member State in which the establishment of teaching is established. Similar exceptions exist for copyrighted databases (Art. XI.191/2 4.º) and for performances, phonograms, film fixations, broadcasts and press publications (Art. XI.217/1 7.º). <br />
