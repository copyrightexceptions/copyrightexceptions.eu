remarks: "In France the exceptions under art.5.2.c and 5.3.n. of the InfoSoc directive share one provision. The reproduction exception extends to all related rights under art. 211-3, 7° and to sui generis database rights under art. 342-3, 5° IPC. The implementation of art.6 of the CDSM Directive did not modify the legal text of L122-5, 8°, which was deemed to already cover uses for the purpose of preservation of cultural heritage (see Report to the President of the Republic concerning Ordinance No. 2021-1518 of 24 November 2021). It, however, led to the extention of the exception to software (art.L122-6-1(V)) and databases (art. 342-3, 5°)."
