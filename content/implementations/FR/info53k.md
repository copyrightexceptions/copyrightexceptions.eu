remarks: "The exception extends to all related rights under art. L. 211-3, 4° IPC.<br /><br />Judicial interpretation corresponds to the conditions formulated by the CJEU in the Deckmyn case (Case C‑201/13). For a certain use to be qualified as a parody there should be no risk of confusion between the original and the derivative work (see Civ. 1ère, 22 mai 2019, 18-12718). Also, it needs to express humour, homage or criticism (TGI Paris, Chambre civile 3, 31 octobre 2007, 06/00430). According to case law preceding the CJEU Deckmyn case, the French court has also established a condition of absence of intention to cause harm (TGI Paris, 29 mai 2001, ONETEL)."
