remarks: "In France the implementation of art.6 of the CDSM Directive did not modify the pre-existing legal text of L122-5, 8°, which houses the transpositions of both exceptions under art.5.2.c and 5.3.n. of the InfoSoc Directive. Its first part was deemed to already cover uses for the purpose of preservation of cultural heritage (see Report to the President of the Republic concerning Ordinance No. 2021-1518 of 24 November 2021). The 2021 modification, however, led to the extention of the exception to software (art.L122-6-1(V)) and databases (art. 342-3, 5°). This reproduction exception extends to all related rights under art. 211-3, 7° and to sui generis database rights under art. 342-3, 5° IPC. "
