remarks: "The provision was introduced in 2021 through an environmental law (Loi n° 2021-1104 du 22 août 2021 portant lutte contre le dérèglement climatique) with the aim of regulating the spare automotive parts market. It amends both copyright and industrial design law. This context likely explains the heterogeneous drafting of the provision, which does not fully align with traditional copyright terminology. As a result, the scope of the exception in terms of subject matter and types of usage remain somewhat unclear, particularly as regards the application of copyright law to the ‘use and marketing of parts’. The exception does not extend to related rights and is a case of a very limited implementation of art.5.3.l of the InfoSoc Directive."
