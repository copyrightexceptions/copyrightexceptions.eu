remarks: "The OOCW regime in France is implemented in parallel and partially overlaps with the pre-existing regime on the use of out-of-print books. OOCWs are referred to as 'some unavailable works' (certaines œuvres indisponibles), as opposed to the 'unavailable books' (livres indisponibles). No express collision clause is available. The regulation of the OOCW fall-back exception is spread throughout the Code, having one general provision in art. L122-5, 13° and a more detailed one in art. L.122-5-5, while the definitions and the rest of the OOCW regime is set in L.138-1 et seq.<br /><br/>The material scope of out-of commerce works is limited, as it cumulates the requirement for reasonable efforts with a minimum cut-off-date. Pursuant to L.138-1(1), a work is deemed unavailable if, after reasonable investigative efforts, can be presumed in good faith to be unavailable to the public through the usual commercial distribution channels **and** whose first publication or communication to the public dates back thirty years or more. The exception extends to neighbouring rights under art. L. 211-3(VII) as well as to sui generis database rights (art. L342-3, 7°). However, with regard to the types of permitted uses, the wording of art. L.122-5-5 is ambiguous as to whether making available to the public falls within the scope of the exception."
