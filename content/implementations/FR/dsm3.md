- "storage and reuse: digital copies and reproductions made during text and data mining are stored with an appropriate level of security and may be retained solely for scientific research purposes, including for verifying research results"
- "safeguards: copyright holders may implement proportionate and necessary measures to ensure the security and integrity of the networks and databases hosting the works. An agreement between representative copyright holder organisations and beneficiaries may define best practices for implementing its provisions"
remarks: "From 2016 until 2022, when the transposition of the CDSM Directive in the field of copyright exceptions took effect, art. L.122-5, 10° contained a pre-existing research-only TDM exception. In 2022, it was replaced by a new general provision on TDM referring to art. L.122-5-3 for further details. Art. L.122-5-3 itself implements art. 3 of the Directive in para II (and art. 4 in para III).<br /><br/>The exception extends to neighbouring rights under art. L. 211-3, 8°, as well as to sui generis database rights (art. L342-3, 6°).<br /><br/>There appear to be no safeguards against contractual override of the implementation of art.3 of the CDSM Directive, except for its application to sui generis database rights (see art. L342-3, 7°(2)), which justifies a lower score for it."
