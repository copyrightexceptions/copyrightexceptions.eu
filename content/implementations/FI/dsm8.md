remarks: "The Finnish implementation of art.8 of the CDSM Directive is comparatively restrictive in two respects. First, it does not require assessment of the representativeness of a CMO as a condition for the application of the exception. Instead, it focuses solely on the availability of a collective licensing scheme. Second, it introduces additional substantive conditions for the use of works beyond the requirement that they be out of commerce, in particular: (i) for computer and video games, at least seven years must have elapsed since publication (§ 16h(3)); (ii) works that have never been made available to the public through customary commercial channels may not be used until five years have passed since their inclusion in the beneficiary’s collection (§ 16h(4)); and (iii) where only a single copy of a work exists, the exception does not apply until after the year of the author’s death (§16h(4)).<br /><br />The exception applies to performances (art.45(7)), sound recordings (art.46(3)), film fixations (art.46a(3)), broadcasts (art.48(4)), databases (art.49(3)), photographs (art.49a(3)) and press publications (art.50(8) of the CA).<br /><br />Art. 11(2) requires that when a work is used publicly under an exception, the author's name and the source must be, as a general rule, stated to the extent and in the manner required by proper usage. It also requires that the work must not be altered more than necessary for the intended use."
