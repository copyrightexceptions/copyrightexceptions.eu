remarks: "Finland has traditionally regulated educational uses through extended collective licensing, and consequently its statutory teaching exceptions are quite narrow in scope. The implementation for art.5 of the CDSM Directive only applies where there is no ECL scheme or any other licensing offer available. This carve-out is not limited to any specific type of subject matter but applies generally, effectively rendering the digital illustration-for-teaching exception a fallback provision with only minimal practical application.<br /><br />The exception also applies to performances (art.45(7)), sound recordings (art.46(3)), film fixations (art.46a(3)), broadcasts (art.48(4)), databases (art.49(3)) and photographs (art.49a(3)). It does not apply to press publications (art.50(8) of the CA).<br /><br />Art. 11(2) requires that when a work is used publicly under an exception, the author's name and the source must be, as a general rule, stated to the extent and in the manner required by proper usage. It also requires that the work must not be altered more than necessary for the intended use."
