remarks: "According to art. 44b, PARA 1, 'text and data mining' is the automated analysis of individual or multiple digital or digitized works in order to extract information, particularly about patterns, trends and correlations.<br /><br />Research organizations are universities, research institutes or other institutions that conduct scientific research, provided that they i) pursue non-commercial purposes, ii)	reinvest all profits in scientific research or iii)	are working in the public interest within the framework of a state-recognized contract. Research organisations which cooperate with a private company which has a decisive influence on the research organisation and preferential access to the results of scientific research are not entitled to the benefit of the exception.<br /><br />Beneficieries may keep copies with appropriate security measures against unauthorised use as long as they are necessary for the purposes of scientific research or for the verification of scientific findings. Rightholders shall have the right to take the necessary measures to prevent the security and integrity of their networks and databases from being compromised by reproductions. Beneficieries can make copies publicly available to i) a clearly defined circle of people for their joint scientific research and ii) individual third parties to check the quality of scientific research.<br /><br />The exception applies accordingly to performances (§83), phonograms (§85(4)), broadcasts (§87(4)), press publications (§87i) and film fixations (§94 UrhG).<br /><br />The exception is imperative. Under § 60g, rightholders may not invoke agreements which restrict or prohibit uses permitted under sections 60a to 60f and such restriction or prohibition is to the detriment of the persons entitled to such use."
