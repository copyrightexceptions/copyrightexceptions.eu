remarks: "The exception applies mutatis mutandis to neighbouring rights under art. 21 of Cap. 415. As per art. 15(6) of S.L. 415.08 of the Laws of Malta, the provisions of art. 9 of the Copyright Act apply mutatis mutandis in respect of press publishers’ rights.<br /><br />This provision remained intact following the implementation of art.5 of the CDSM Directive. Art.4 of Subsidiary Legislation 415.08 of the Laws of Malta (2021) introduced a new teaching exception applicable exclusively to digital uses. The relationship between the two teaching exceptions, however, is somewhat unclear. Notably, art.23 of S.L. 415.08 contains a collision clause providing that the newly introduced exceptions are not prejudiced or limited in scope by pre-existing exceptions, though the converse is not expressly stated. Moreover, the new teaching exception does not appear to extend to related rights, other than press publishers’ rights and the sui generis database right."
