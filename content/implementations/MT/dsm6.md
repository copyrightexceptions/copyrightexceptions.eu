Where the application of any effective technological measure to a work prevents any beneficiary from benefiting from that exception, the rightholder shall make available to the beneficiary the means  of benefiting from that exception, to the extent necessary to benefit from that exception.<br /><br />The exception appears not to apply to other related rights, apart from press publishers’ rights and sui generis database rights."
