remarks: "As most Greek national exceptions, this one precedes the InfoSoc Directive. Another pre-existing exceptions that can be regarded as partially covering the scope of art. 5.3.(a) is art. 20 of the Greek law named 'School Textbooks and Anthologies' which permits, without the author's consent and without payment, the reproduction by means of printing of small parts of lawfully published literary works of one or more writers in educational textbooks approved for use in primary and secondary education by the Ministry of National Education and Religions or another competent ministry, according to the official detailed syllabus.<br /><br />Although in 2023 the exception was supplemented by the implementation or art. 5 of the CDSM Directive (in para 2 et seq.), the latter provide for an extremely restricted interpretation of the EU provision, introducing a limited (up to 5%) and remunerated exception for digital use, overridable in its entirety by licence availability."
