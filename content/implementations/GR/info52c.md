remarks: "Most Greek national exceptions are first drafted with the adoption of the law in 1993 and precede the InfoSoc Directive, which is why they rarely are conform to the Directive's wording. Other pre-existing exceptions can be regarded as partially covering the scope of art. 5.2.(c). For instance, art. 20 of the Greek law named 'School Textbooks and Anthologies' permits, without the author's consent and without payment, the reproduction by means of printing of small parts of lawfully published literary works of one or more writers in educational textbooks approved for use in primary and secondary education by the Ministry of National Education and Religions or another competent ministry, according to the official detailed syllabus.<br /><br />Likewise, art. 21 named 'Reproduction for Teaching Purposes'permits, without the consent of the author and without payment, the reproduction of articles lawfully published in a newspaper or periodical, short extracts of a work or parts of a short work or a lawfully published work of fine art work exclusively for teaching or examination purposes at an educational establishment, in such measure as is compatible with the aforementioned purpose, provided that the reproduction is effected in accordance with fair practice and does not conflict with the normal exploitation.<br /><br />The use case was slightly broadened in 2023 with the implementation of art.6 of the CDSM Directive in art.22A of the Greek law.<br /><br />Under art. 52, the limitations applicable to the economic rights of copyright  apply mutatis mutandis to related rights."
