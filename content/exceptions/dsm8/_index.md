title: "Use of out-of-commerce works by cultural heritage institutions (Art. 8 DSM)"
short: "dsm8"
draft: "false"
summary: "This (mandatory) exception or limitation allows certain cultural heritage institutions to make available out-of-commerce works and other protected subject matter, for non-commercial purposes. The particular rights (e.g. reproduction, communication to the public, distribution etc) covered by the exception vary according to the type of material used. Out-of-commerce materials are those that have never been in commerce (e.g. posters, amateur works, unpublished works) and those that were in commerce and no longer are available through customary channels of commerce. Cultural heritage institutions have to make a reasonable effort to determine whether a work is in or out of commerce, although there is no mandatory work-by-work search. Member States are allowed to provide specific requirements to determine whether a work is out-of-commerce, such as a date before which everything is considered to be out-of-commerce (cut-off date). Only those materials that are permanently in the collections of a cultural heritage institution can be used under this exception. Furthermore, the exception only applies for the rights and types of materials for which no collecting management organization qualifies as “sufficiently representative” to grant licenses. Uses allowed under this exception are not subject to compensation. The exception applies across-borders thanks to a legal fiction that says that the use is deemed to occur in the Member State where the cultural heritage institution is established."
